This project is a comprehensive MERN stack application that demonstrates the integration of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It includes features such as user management, RESTful API implementation, Docker containerization, and Python for data analysis.

## Project Structure

- **Node.js**: A basic Node.js server that listens on port 3000 and returns a "Hello, World!" message at the root URL.
  
- **Express.js**: A simple REST API with a `/users` route that returns a JSON list of users.

- **React**: A basic React component that fetches the list of users from the `/users` API and displays them in a table.

- **MongoDB**: A schema for storing user data (name, email, age) along with a script to insert new users into the collection.

- **Express.js + MongoDB**: An API route that fetches a user by their email from the MongoDB database.

- **React + State Management**: A form component that allows users to submit their name, email, and age. Upon submission, it sends the data to the backend API and updates the displayed user list.

- **React Routing**: Implemented React Router to navigate between a Home page and a Users page.

- **RESTful API Design**: Designed a REST API for a simple blog application with CRUD routes for managing blog posts.

## Docker Configuration

- **Dockerfile**: Contains instructions to build a Docker image for the Node.js Express application, installing dependencies and running the server on port 3000.

- **Docker Compose**: A configuration file that sets up a multi-container application with a Node.js server and a MongoDB database.

- **Docker Networking**: Configured Docker networking to enable communication between the Node.js application and MongoDB.

### Advantages of Using Docker
Using Docker for deploying this MERN stack application enhances development workflows by providing:
- Consistent development environments across different systems.
- Simplified dependency management.
- Easy scaling and deployment of applications.

### Real-world Use Case
In a production environment, Docker can be used to run microservices in isolation, allowing for easier updates and management.

## Version Control with Git

- **Basic Git Commands**: 
  - Initialize a repository: `git init`
  - Make a commit: `git add .`, then `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
  - Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`

- **Branching Strategy**: Implemented a common branching strategy such as GitFlow for managing feature development.

- **Merging and Resolving Conflicts**: Follow these steps to resolve merge conflicts:
  1. Identify conflicting files.
  2. Edit the files to resolve conflicts in editor.
  3. Stage the resolved files: `git add <file>`
  4. Complete the merge: `git commit`

- **CI/CD Integration**: A basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions is set up to automatically test and deploy the Node.js application upon changes pushed to the repository.

## Python for Data Analysis

- **Data Cleaning**: A Python script using Pandas that reads a CSV file, drops rows with missing values, and outputs the cleaned data.

- **Data Manipulation**: A function that returns the top 5 rows where a specific column (e.g., "age") has values greater than 30.

- **Data Visualization**: A bar chart created using Matplotlib to visualize the distribution of user ages.

- **Descriptive Statistics**: A script that calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of a specified column (e.g., "age") using NumPy and Pandas.

## Additional Resources

- **Postman Collection**: A Postman collection is included for testing the API endpoints.
